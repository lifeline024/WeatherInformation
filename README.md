# 🌤️ Weather Monitoring System
An IoT-based project for tracking weather conditions in real time! Using ESP8266 and multiple sensors,
this system monitors temperature, humidity, light intensity, and atmospheric pressure, displaying the
data on a web interface for easy access.

# 🌐 Overview
The Weather Monitoring System gathers environmental data using sensors connected to an ESP8266 microcontroller.
It sends data to Blynk and ThingSpeak cloud platforms, enabling real-time and remote monitoring through a responsive web interface.

# ✨ Features
  01. Real-time Monitoring: Temperature, humidity, pressure, and light levels displayed live!
  02. Cloud Storage: Data stored in Blynk and ThingSpeak for easy access anytime, anywhere.
  03. Responsive Design: Mobile-friendly for monitoring on the go.
  04. Interactive UI: Clean, visually appealing dashboard for an enjoyable user experience.
